This lesson is about the options configuration of TS in the tsconfig.json file:

- exclude: exclude files from being compiled.
- include: include file which should get compiled.
- target: the es version which should be compiled from TS
- outDir: instead of compiling TS files to JS next to each other, place JS files in a destined location.
- rootDir: specify a root folder.
- allowJs: allow JS files to be placed with TS files in a project.
- checkJs: allow type-checking on JS files.
- lib: if commented out, TS will be aware of all the features included "target" option.
       if is empty, will resolve in errors because TS will not know any JS features.
- noEmitOnError: if set to true, will not compile any TS files to JS if any error on any file will occure.
