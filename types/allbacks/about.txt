This lesson is about callback type in TS.

Callbacks types can be configured as functions types(see lesson 13 for more info).

There is something which might seems like a mistake or a bug in TS callbacks.
If a callback is configured to return nothing("void") and inside that callback execution - a return statement with a value is written,
No error will occure because even due the statement was declared, TS will ignore this and make sure nothing is returned
So the developer won't get "punished".
