This lesson is about the unkown type in TS.

The "unkown" type have some simularity to the "any" type.

- If a variable is of type "unkown", it can be reassigned to many types, just like "any".
- If a variable is of type "unkown" and is reassigned to another variable which holds a specific type definition, an error will get triggered,
  Because even though it can be reassigned, it can be reassigned to anything. with "any" an error won't occure because it is more flexible.
- Reassigning with a declared specific type can be done if a check is applied(if statement).
