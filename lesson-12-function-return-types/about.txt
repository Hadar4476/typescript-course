This lesson is about the type of functions returns in TS

If a value is returned from a function there is a syntax to determine what it's type would be.

If a function does not have a return statement, the type which should be declared is "void".
"void" is a type which is specific for function which determine that this function should not return anything.
Using "void", a function can still use the return statement but can not return a value;

If something undefined should be returned, it must be declared as a type of "undefined" and it MUST return something which is undefined.
